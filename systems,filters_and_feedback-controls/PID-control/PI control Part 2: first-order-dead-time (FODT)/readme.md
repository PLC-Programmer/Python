I tried to emulate the 12 tanks in series process with 12 first-order lag terms (PT1) in series:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/Step%20response%20for%20tanks%20in%20series.png)

(see source from below)

However, with the given setup the maximum I can emulate are indeed and apparently only 6 x PT1 terms.

When adding only one more element, that is to emulate a 7 x PT1 process, numerical problems obviously start to creep into the process simulation:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/3.5f7a_7xPT1_step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20d.png)

..here in form of overswinging, something which can totally be excluded as a step response of a b0 / (a1*s + a0)^n process.

<br/>

Now I come back to my plan as stated below (*Let's see how this works in an updated, closed control loop program.*) and put the 6 x PT1 process into a closed control loop with the PI controller algorithm by Karl Johan Åström (https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/3.5f6_PI-control-loop_with_6xPT1_Euler_forward_process.py) and where the control parameters are set according to the lambda tuning rules, based on the estimated time constants td and tau of the unit step response of the open loop:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/3.5f6_PI-control-loop_with_6xPT1_Euler_forward_process%20a.png)

Here, the same control action without the simulated noise:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/3.5f6_PI-control-loop_with_6xPT1_Euler_forward_process%20b.png)

Above overswinging is due to the fact that factor *taucl* has been set to a fast 1.0.

Here the same with *taucl* set to a more moderate 1.5:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/3.5f6_PI-control-loop_with_6xPT1_Euler_forward_process%20c.png)

Here the same with *taucl* set to the original and slow value of 3.0:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/3.5f6_PI-control-loop_with_6xPT1_Euler_forward_process%20e.png)

<br/>

At last, an experiment with a transient disturbance where I commented on in the source code: "...but a transient disturbance apparently looks not realistic". I made this specific  statement because I miss a real world example - *everything* here is simulated.

But what I can say is that with a simulation with a difference equation of this high order of 6 even a very small disturbance amplitude of 0.000000001 leads to a rather unrealistic control action like this (here with unbounded controller output):

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/3.5f6_PI-control-loop_with_6xPT1_Euler_forward_process%20d.png)

Now let's combine the current achievements and apply them to the unit step response of a process with lag of 6th order: https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/3.5f6a_6xPT1_step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning.py

Works like a charm so far, even with the simple Euler forward approximation.

2025-03-10

So far the simulation of noise on the measurement, which goes into the controller algorithm, was presented with an extra variable *x1_noisy* in program https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20-%20experiments.py, a luxury we don't have in the closed control loop.

Now I got the idea to take back older and memorized noise data points from system state variable x1 when updating *x1[k+1]*:

```
for k in range(2,STEPS):
    ...
    if k < STEPS-1:
        ...
        x1[k+1] = 1.0/a1**3.0 * ((a1**3.0 - A0)*x1[k-2]/x1_noise[k-2] \
                                     - 3.0*a1**2.0*(a0*h - a1)*x1[k]/x1_noise[k] \
                                     - 3.0*a1*A1*x1[k-1]/x1_noise[k-1] \
                                     + b0*h**3.0*u[k-2])
        ...
        if NOISE is True:
            x1[k+1] = x1[k+1] * x1_noise[k+1]
```

from: https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20-%20experiments2.py

So instead of *x1[k-2]* the term *x1[k-2]/x1_noise[k-2]* is being employed in the difference equation for example, which apparently produces the same noisy signal like we have seen so far:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20-%20experiments2%20b.png)

And remember that the controller algorithm is being executed *before* the process simulation part in the system simulation loop: https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/3.5f3_PI-control-loop_with_3xPT1_Euler_forward_process.py

Then I double checked this noise solution on *x1* with the noiseless system state variable *x1_clean*:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20-%20experiments2%20c.png)

This looks OK.

Let's see how this works in an updated, closed control loop program.

------

2025-03-08c

Well, nothing keeps us from applying a Savitzky–Golay filter two times:

```
if min(x1_grad) < -0.00001:  # leave some room for error
    NOISE_PRESENT = True

    # Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering of measurement:
    WINDOW_SIZE = 41  # 71: manual tuning --> OKish for one filter run
    POLYNOMIAL_ORDER = 1  # 1: manual tuning --> better tuning rule??

    # 1st filter run:
    x1_hat = savgol_filter(x1_org, WINDOW_SIZE, POLYNOMIAL_ORDER)

    # 2nd filter run:
    x1_hat2 = savgol_filter(x1_hat, WINDOW_SIZE, POLYNOMIAL_ORDER)

```

...and Whoa! After some short experimentation a (non-sluggish) window size of 41 with double filtering looks quite convincing:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2006j.png)

Here a double filtered step response:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2006k.png)

With the exception of the (usual) filter artefact (of a Savitzky–Golay filter) at the beginning of the step response, both gradient curves are undistinguishable now:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2006l.png)

..which makes finding a "good" tangential line much easier:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2006m.png)

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2006n.png)

And so the estimated times should not be too far off from the true but uknown values:

*maximum gradient of potentially noisy measurement x1 = 0.00272*

*at time = 2.18000*

*maximum gradient of noise-free x1 = 0.00272*

*at time = 2.01000*

*SIGMA = 0.01*

*Savitzky-Golay filtering (2x):*

*polynomial order = 1 (manually tuned)*

*window size = 41 (manually tuned)*

------

2025-03-08b

A natural idea to estimate a plausible time for the maximum slope is to filter the noisy measurement.

By the way: the current and very simple idea to detect a noisy measurement is only working for positive step responses of self-regulating processes (https://www.isa.org/intech-home/2016/may-june/departments/loop-tuning-basics-self-regulating-processes), where - without noise - the gradient must be zero or higher:

```
if min(x1_grad) < -0.00001:  # leave some room for error
    NOISE_PRESENT = True
    ...
```

Since we don't have to filter a noisy measurement while the process is developing (with an online solution like a moving average for example), we can do it *after* the bump test, here with a Savitzky–Golay filter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter

For example like this:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2006a.png)

However, after some experimentations it shows that finding "good" filter parameters, that is window size and polynomial order, isn't so straightforward.

Just increasing the window size and/or the polynomial order doesn't lead to a "good" solution apparently:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2006g.png)

So, I've written a test routine to check manually what at least the best window size good be by "visual inspection" (a polynomial order of just 1 seems to be a good fit though):


```
ws = np.arange(11,161,10)  # test a range of window sizes
x1_test_time_ws =  [0.0 for i in ws]
WS_TESTS = 10000
time_i = 0
for ws_i in ws:
    x1_test_time = []
    for i in range(0,WS_TESTS):
        x1_sg = savgol_filter(x1_org, ws_i, 1)  # polynomial order seems to be OK
        x1_grad_t = np.gradient(x1_sg)
        max_x1_grad_index_t = np.argmax(x1_grad_t)
        max_x1_grad_time_t = t[max_x1_grad_index_t]
        x1_test_time.append(max_x1_grad_time_t)

    x1_test_time_ws[time_i] = np.mean(x1_test_time)
    time_i += 1

x1_test_time_min = np.empty(len(x1_test_time_ws))
x1_test_time_min = abs(x1_test_time_ws - max_x1_grad_no_noise_time)
good_ws = ws[np.argmin(x1_test_time_min)]

print(f'\nA good window size for a Savitzky-Golay filter\
 based on {WS_TESTS} test runs is {good_ws}\n')
```

...and as documented in the comment of the test routine (https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20-%20experiments.py) this test only showed that moving the window size up and down (with the given noise) doesn't find a convincing solution.

<br/>

What now?

------

2025-03-08a

However, there's one big drawback with a simulation like this:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2000.png)

..and it's noise. Nothing in nature runs so smoothly because nature is full of noise:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2004.png)

By the way: I changed the noise logic completely since the old solution just leads to a nonlinear system:

```
for k in range(2,STEPS):
    ...
    # process:
    if k < STEPS-1:
        ...
        # x1_KJA[k+1] = x1_KJA[k+1] * x1_KJA_noise[k+1]
```

from: https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/3.5f3_PI-control-loop_with_3xPT1_Euler_forward_process.py

The "clean" state variable for the process simulation must be kept separated from a noisy measurement, where noise, be it additive or multiplicative, is **not injected** into a state variable, which has  memory, but is just applied to it at an extra array:

```
x1       = np.zeros([STEPS])  # clean measurement = clean process output
x1_noisy = np.zeros([STEPS])  # noisy measurement = noisy process output
# noise has no memory (--> Markov process) and thus the simulation of a noisy measurement
# needs an extra array
...
# process simulation loop:
for k in range(2,STEPS):

    # process:
    if k < STEPS-1:
        ...
        x1[k+1] = 1.0/a1**3.0 * ((a1**3.0 - A0)*x1[k-2] \
                                     - 3.0*a1**2.0*(a0*h - a1)*x1[k] \
                                     - 3.0*a1*A1*x1[k-1]
                                     + b0*h**3.0*u[k-2])

        if NOISE is True:
            x1_noisy[k+1] = x1[k+1] * x1_noise[k+1]
...
```

<br/>

And the ubiquitous presence of noise is a big problem when calculating the gradient, to get the maximum slope, in a naive way:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2005.png)

*NOISE_PRESENT = True*

*maximum gradient of x1 = 0.02217*

*at time = 6.15000*

=> the targeted maximum slope for the tangential line is for sure not to be found at 6.15 seconds.

Re: *I'm estimating these parameter values at:*

*dead time td ≈ 0.8 seconds*

*time constant tau ≈ 2.4 seconds*

A natural question arises here: can the computer estimate these process parameters conveniently and also more accurately?

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2000.png)

Of course, the program can be expanded for this job:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2001.png)

My idea here is simply to first compute the gradient of the step response d(x1(t))/dt (in blue color above): see from the link below:

*Find the maximum slope of the PV response curve. This will be at the point of inflection. Draw a line tangential through the PV response curve at this point.*

```
# calculating the gradient of the measurement:
x1_grad = np.gradient(x1)
```

To make the really small values of the gradient more visible (*np.max(x1_grad) = 0.002720*) in the same diagram I applied a factor of 20 to the gradient curve.

So, I got this tangential line in black color at the step response:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2002.png)

See again from the link below:

*Dead Time (td) ... Extend this line to intersect with the original level of the PV before the step in CO. Take note of the time value at this intersection.*

*td = time difference between the change in CO and the intersection of the tangential line and the original PV level*

...

*Time Constant (tau) ... tau = time difference between intersection at the end of dead time, and the PV reaching 63% of its total change*

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/pictures/step_response_parameter_estimation_for_lambda_tuning%20--%2003.png)

So, this algorithm estimated these parameter values:

* dead time td ≈ 0.83 seconds

* time constant tau ≈ 2.31 seconds

..which don't seem to too far off from my manual readings.

That was not too complicated to program.

------

2025-03-06:

Now let's put another tank, as a PT1 model again, in series. Then the unit step responses so far look like this:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/3.5f3_PI-control-loop_with_3xPT1_Euler_forward_process%20-%20step%20responses%20PT1%2C%20PT2%2C%20PT3.png)

..and have been generated with this program: https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/3.5f3_PI-control-loop_with_3xPT1_Euler_forward_process.py

(this program, at least for now, contains a lot of commented source code lines for all the experimentations)

<br/>

With three tanks in series I can manually and roughly make parameter estimations according to the lambda tuning rules; see from here again: https://blog.opticontrols.com/archives/260

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/Step%20Test%20for%20Lambda%20Tuning.png)

I'm estimating these parameter values at:

* dead time td ≈ 0.8 seconds
* time constant tau ≈ 2.4 seconds

To not have a too sluggish step response under feedback control, I've chosen a "taucl factor" of 1.5: 

*Generally, the value for taucl should be set between one and three times the value of tau.*

```
tau=2.4  # [sec]; rough human reading
gp=1.0
taucl_factor = 1.5  # org: 3.0
taucl=taucl_factor*tau
td=0.8  # [sec]; rough human reading
# =>
Kp = tau/(gp * (taucl + td))
Tn = tau
```

Finally, the step response of the closed control loop with three tanks in series and the chosen control parameters looks like this:

![plot](https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/3.5f3_PI-control-loop_with_3xPT1_Euler_forward_process.png)


There's a slight modification with this version of the simulation program. It's the starting at index 2, not 1 like before:

```
for k in range(2,STEPS):
    ...
```

By this offset, the program is not reading "values from the past" at the process simulation part:

```
    # process:
    if k < STEPS-1:
        ...
        x1_KJA[k+1] = 1.0/a1**3.0 * ((a1**3.0 - A0)*x1_KJA[k-2] \
                                     - 3.0*a1**2.0*(a0*h - a1)*x1_KJA[k] \
                                     - 3.0*a1*A1*x1_KJA[k-1]
                                     + b0*h**3.0*u_KJA[k-2])
```


------

2025-03-05c:

By default the SymPy Live Shell produces an output in form of a LaTeX expression, something which may be of limited use for further human interaction to get the final difference equation for the source code.

So, I expanded the little SymPy script to print the result in plain text format:

```
a1, a0, b0, X1, U, h, s = symbols('a1, a0, b0, X1, U, h, s')
s =  (z - 1 ) / h
X1 = b0 / ((a1*s + a0)*(a1*s + a0)) * U
result = simplify(collect(expand(X1),z))
str(result)
```

In case of the two PT1 terms in series the output in plain text format looks like this:

```
'U*b0*h**2/(a0**2*h**2 - 2*a0*a1*h + a1**2*(z**2 + 1) + 2*a1*z*(a0*h - a1))'
```

Now let's put two tanks, each with a PT1 model, in series. Transfer function of this process will look like this:

X1(s)/U(s) = b0 / ((a1·s + a0)·(a1·s + a0))

Again I'm using the Euler forward emulation of this process with its approximation s ≈  (z - 1 ) / h

The resulting (and approximated) transfer function starts to become complicated. So, I'm using the SymPy Live Shell for helping with the indermediate steps: https://live.sympy.org/

```
a1, a0, b0, X1, U, h, s = symbols('a1, a0, b0, X1, U, h, s')
s =  (z - 1 ) / h
X1 = b0 / ((a1*s + a0)*(a1*s + a0)) * U
simplify(collect(expand(X1),z))
```

Everything else unchanged, including the controller parameters (https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/3.5f2_PI-control-loop_with_2xPT1_Euler_forward_process.py) the step response looks promising:

I can't call this done according to "(lambda tuning rules)" anymore, so I left this comment away.

Anyhow, the step response became faster, and with a very slight overshoot, which is logical with unchanged controller parameters (which are a little bit too fast now).

I start with only one tank as my process, that is a PT1 term (lag of first order): https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/blob/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT)/3.5f1_PI-control-loop_with_PT1_Euler_forward_process.py

The unit step response will look like this:

As announced below, I used the Lambda Tuning Rules (https://blog.opticontrols.com/archives/260) with PI controller parameters:

- Controller Gain Kc = tau/(gp x (taucl + td))
- Integral Time Ti = tau

```
tau=1.0
gp=1.0
taucl=3*tau
td=0.0
# =>
Kp = tau/(gp * (taucl + td))
Tn = tau
```

First-order-dead-time (FODT) is also called first-order-plus-dead-time, FOPDT:

From: Process Dynamics, Operations, and Control, Lesson 7, High Order Overdamped Processes, 2006: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/10-450-process-dynamics-operations-and-control-spring-2006/9323048e3f2ffc52e50708760833e598_7_high_order.pdf

<br/>

Otherwise:

There's a ton of (academic) literature on feedback control of FODT processes out there -- but boy -- just a simple overview of tuning rules for this ubiquitous combination of a PI controller and a PT1 (lag of first order) process?!?

So, for the first experiment I apply the **Lambda Tuning Rules** (https://blog.opticontrols.com/archives/260) as a starting point.
