First-order-dead-time (FODT) is also called first-order-plus-dead-time, FOPDT:

From: Process Dynamics, Operations, and Control, Lesson 7, High Order Overdamped Processes, 2006: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/10-450-process-dynamics-operations-and-control-spring-2006/9323048e3f2ffc52e50708760833e598_7_high_order.pdf

Otherwise:

There's a ton of (academic) literature on feedback control of FODT processes out there -- but boy -- just a simple overview of tuning rules for this ubiquitous combination of a PI controller and a PT1 (lag of first order) process?!?

So, for the first experiment I apply the **Lambda Tuning Rules** (https://blog.opticontrols.com/archives/260) as a starting point.
