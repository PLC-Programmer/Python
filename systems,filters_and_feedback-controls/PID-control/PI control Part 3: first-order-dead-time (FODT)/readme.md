Now I try to simulate the 6 tanks in series process exactly with a **First-Order-Dead-Time (FODT)** process, also often called First-Order Plus Dead-Time (FOPDT) process, based on the estimated process time constants of Part 2: https://github.com/PLC-Programmer/Python/tree/master/systems%2Cfilters_and_feedback-controls/PID-control/PI%20control%20Part%202%3A%20first-order-dead-time%20(FODT), here without simulated process noise:
